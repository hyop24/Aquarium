	<h1>Clownfish</h1>
	<img src="image/clownfish2.jpg">
	<p>Clownfish live in coral reefs and are typically located throughout most of the tropical Indo-Pacific. In the wild, these fish need protection from anemone, which repels predators. Clownfish never live without its host anemone. They can grow up to 4.5 inches, and their diet consists of tiny animals like plankton and copepods, as well as algae.</p>
	<h2>Fun facts</h2>
	<p>
		- Clownfish are all born male and can become female over time
